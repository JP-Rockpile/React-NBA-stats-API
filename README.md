# React-NBA-stats-API

This program searches the Ball Dont Lie NBA API that contains NBA player stats and statistics. 

A roadmap for future improvements includes adding custom CSS to better present the information. Unfortunately some data is missing from the API.
Add toggle option for players or teams to reveal more statistics.
